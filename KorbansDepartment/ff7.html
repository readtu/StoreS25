    <h3>*Final Fantasy IV* is a classic role-playing game developed and published by Square (now Square Enix) for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1991. It tells the compelling story of Cecil Harvey, a dark knight who embarks on a journey of redemption after betraying his king. As Cecil grapples with his inner conflict, he forms a diverse group of allies, including warriors, mages, and other unique characters, each with their own personal struggles and motivations. The game introduces the Active Time Battle (ATB) system, which adds real-time strategy to turn-based combat, making each battle dynamic and engaging. *Final Fantasy IV* also explores themes of heroism, self-discovery, and the battle between good and evil, with memorable moments and plot twists that have left a lasting impact on fans. The game's success led to numerous ports, remakes, and sequels, cementing it as a cornerstone of the *Final Fantasy* series.</h3>
