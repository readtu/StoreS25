    <h3>*The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass* is an action-adventure game developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo DS in 2007. Serving as a direct sequel to *The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker*, it continues the adventures of Link as he embarks on a quest to rescue his friend Tetra, who has been kidnapped by a mysterious phantom ship. The game features a unique blend of traditional *Zelda* gameplay with innovative use of the DS’s touchscreen controls, where players navigate through dungeons, solve puzzles, and battle enemies by drawing paths and making use of the stylus. The game’s distinctive art style retains the cel-shaded aesthetic from *Wind Waker*, bringing a vibrant and colorful world to the handheld. One of its standout features is the use of the Phantom Hourglass itself, which is key to navigating through the dangerous Temple of the Ocean King. The game received praise for its engaging puzzle-solving elements, charming characters, and immersive world, making it a standout title in the *Zelda* series and a fan favorite on the DS.</h3>
