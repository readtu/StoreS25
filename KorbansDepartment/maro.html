    <h3>*New Super Mario Bros.* for the Nintendo DS, released in 2006, marked the return of Mario to his classic side-scrolling platformer roots after a long absence. The game combines the traditional gameplay elements of earlier *Super Mario* titles with fresh features and updated graphics, bringing the beloved plumber's adventures to the handheld system. Players control Mario as he ventures through various worlds, each filled with creative enemies, platforming challenges, and power-ups like the Super Mushroom and the Mega Mushroom. A standout feature of the game is its multiplayer mode, where two players can join forces in cooperative gameplay or compete against each other. *New Super Mario Bros.* also introduced the ability for Mario to transform into a giant version of himself, allowing for massive, screen-clearing fun. With its catchy soundtrack, tight controls, and nostalgic charm, it became an instant hit and is often regarded as one of the best titles on the DS.</h3>
